## About The Project

![Portfolio](https://res.cloudinary.com/mayur28/image/upload/v1626412942/markdownWebsite_thxvf4.png)

As you have already know from my [portfolio](https://www.mayuragarwal.in/) that my focussed is on creating the user-friendly websites that deliver over the top experience. It delivers clean and easy-to-use user-experience with excellent responsiveness. Some key points which I keep in mind while developing the projects:

- Must provide clean and easy-to-use experience.
- Must provide better responsiveness for all screen sizes.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using.Here are a few examples.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [onScrollAnimation](https://dbramwell.github.io/react-animate-on-scroll/)

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

### Run the development server

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
